// P: float, representing a time in hours
// R: integer, representing an amount of liters of water drunk
//      specs say: 0.5 liters of water per hour, rounded to the smallest value
//      from examples, it appears this means specs require floor

// E:
liters(3) // 1
liters(1.4) // 0  (from this example, it is apparent we need a floor function)
